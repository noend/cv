I became more confident in evaluating trade-offs, prioritizing features, and choosing the right tools and methodologies based on the problem at hand.\n\nAdditionally, I regularly collaborated with cross-functional teams, including QA, DevOps, and product stakeholders, to ensure alignment and deliver value consistently. This experience was a key stage in my growth as an engineer, as it helped me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical execution, and laid the groundwork for taking on more strategic roles in future projects.",
