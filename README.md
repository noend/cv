These features help create more professional, polished content with minimal effort.

## 🖼️ Image Uploads & Version Control

Uploaded images (such as profile pictures) are stored in the `/public/uploads` directory. This folder is included in `.gitignore` by default to avoid accidentally committing large or sensitive files. A `gitkeep` file is present to ensure the folder exists in the repository structure.

**If you want to commit uploaded images (e.g., profile-\*.webp) to your repository:**

- You must explicitly add them with the `-f` (force) flag, since `/public/uploads` is git-ignored:

```bash
git add .\public\uploads\profile-* -f
```

- This will add all matching uploaded images, not just the modified files.
- Remember to commit and push after adding.

> **Note:** If you do not force-add, new or updated images in `/public/uploads` will not be tracked by git and will not appear on your deployed site.

## 📚 Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set in your `.env` file:

```
# Admin authentication
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# OpenRouter API for AI features
OPENROUTER_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key
OPENROUTER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4.1-nano
```
